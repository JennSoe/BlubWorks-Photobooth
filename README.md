# BlobWorks Digital Photobooth

## What is it?
A small personal photobooth experiment made by me!  
Inspired by *Nashallery’s Photobooth*, this version is designed for desktop and built with React + TypeScript + Vite.  
In which, users can upload or take their own photos and arrange them into cute photostrips with switchable templates 

## Booth's Features

- Upload or take photos directly in the browser  
- Generate your own photostrips 
- Switch between templates *(more coming soon!)*
- Cute decorations and soft color palette  
- Download your finished strip as an image 

## Tech Stack

Built with:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

## Setup
